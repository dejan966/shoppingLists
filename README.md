## Shopping lists

This is a shopping list app made for families. Every member of the family can use it. They can add an item, remove and edit it, they can mark the item as bought and this state will be reflected in all iterations of the app. The list can also be exported and imported as JSON. When imported it will overide the current list in the app. The app has been created with the Next.js. It's an open-source and JavaScript framework, allowing you to develop fast and user-friendly web applications and static websites using React.
